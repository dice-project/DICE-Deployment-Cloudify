New in 0.7.3:

* DMon agent is now installed on nodes that are hosting Apache Spark components.

New in 0.7.2:

* FCO server creation process on FCO is now serialized. This is a work-around
  for the FCO's random failures of server creation when 4 or more servers are
  requested in a short time.
* Using DICE Chef cookbook version 0.1.14.

New in 0.7.1:

* Use of DICE Chef Repository v.0.1.13.

New in 0.7.0:

* Library is no longer split into per-platform components, since we now
  use custom plugin for provisioning instances on supported platforms.
* Addition of EC2 platform.
* Added MongoDB TOSCA types.
* Low-level API has been changed and blueprint authors need to update their
  blueprints. High level API stayed the same.

New in 0.2.8:

* DICER compatibility fixes.

New in 0.2.7:

* Force ssh to use key-based authentication.

New in v.0.2.6:

* Added monitoring support for script runner.
* For monitored node templates, it is now possible to assign
  an arbitrary role to be used when the node registers with
  the DICE Monitoring.
* Any node registered with DICE Monitoring will now request
  a removal from the DICE Monitoring during the uninstallation.
* Enabled downloading of multiple resource files.

New in v.0.2.5:

* Support for CentOS 7 hosts was added to the library.
* TOSCA types supporting ScyllaDB installation were added.
* Cassandra types gained monitoring support.
* Chef client version has been increased to the latest stable version.
* Apache Storm topology registration has been synced with upstream DMon.

New in v.0.2.4:

* Apache Storm submitter has been fixed and now properly handles topology
  configuration.

New in v.0.2.3:

* Added generation templates for Spark, Hadoop, Kafka and script runner TOSCA
  types.
* Made sure that apt cache is fresh before any apt operation is started.
* Made FCO custom firewall rules usable.

New in v.0.2.2:

* Added user's custom script runner TOSCA type and the accompanying
  resources
* Added Apache Kafka TOSCA types. Currently there are no relationships
  supported with Kafka yet
* Added HDFS TOSCA types
* Added Apache YARN types
* Added Apache Spark job submitter, supporting client mode
* Added Apache Storm node DMon monitoring support
* Added Spark node DMon monitoring support
* Added support for FQDN setting propagation in TOSCA runtime properties.
* Moved the `ConnectedToZookeeperQuorum` to a more general namespace
* Replaces Apache Zookeeper cookbook runlist to use the new cookbooks
* Unified Java versions across all types. For now this is version 8 of
  the OpenJDK
* Fixes Apache Storm cluster setup in 1.x to use the DNS server where
  previously only IP addresses worked
* Removed worker process from Storm Nimbus type to free the Nimbus
  node's resources needed for complex topologies

New in v.0.2.1:

* Added firewall rules for Zookeeper, Storm, Cassandra as a node types.
* Apache Storm topology can now be parametrized, supplying user's custom command
  line parameters to the topology submitter.
* Enabled DNS query redirection to the Consul micro DNS server installed with
  the DICE deployment service.
* Abstracted virtual IP address to mask differences in platforms (floating
  IPs in OpenStack, etc.)
  * On FCO platform, virtual IP does not really exist, hence for FCO it is
    mapped to a dummy node template.
* Made DICE library modular, loadable through nested imports. This change
  requires that Cloudify Manager 3.4.0 is used as the back-end.
* Added task for downloading selected resource during the Cloudify workflows
  to prepare files for Chef recipes, which themselves have no access to
  Cloudify resources.
* Enabled merging and deduplication of inputs and other lists.

New in v.0.1.3:
* Added support for Apache Cassandra in the technology library.
* Added support for Spark in technology library. At this time we support
  the stand-alone version only.
* Added support for installing DICE Deployment Service - the server side.

New in v.0.1.2:

* Initial support for deployments reconfiguration. This will enable
  that the existing deployments will not need to be destroyed
  before applying changed configurations to the existing nodes.
* Storm topologies can be reconfigured. This is achieved by simply
  killing existing topology, updating configuration and then
  resubmitting the same topology.
* Added configuration field to Storm topology. Now the users'
  Storm topologies can receive arbitrary configuration to be
  applied at submission.
* Storm topology submission is now idempotent. Topology equality
  is determined by comparing names, so the same jar can still run
  multiple times on storm, but it needs ta have different names for
  each execution.
