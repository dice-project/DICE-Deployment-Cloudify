# Types and relationships that make it possible to create Docker hosts and run
# containers on them.


data_types:

  dice.datatypes.docker.RegistryAuth:
    description: Authentication data for docker registry
    properties:
      username: { required: false }
      password: { required: false }


node_types:

  dice.components.docker.Server:
    description: Docker instance that can host containers.
    derived_from: dice.chef.SoftwareComponent
    properties:
      create_runlist:
        default:
          - recipe[apt::default]
          - recipe[dice_common::default]
          - recipe[docker::default]
      configure_runlist:
        default:
          - recipe[docker::configure]
      start_runlist:
        default:
          - recipe[docker::start]
    attributes:
      address:
        description: >
          Address that can be passed to clients when connecting to docker
          server. Typically, this will be set to something like
          tcp://1.2.3.4:2375.

  dice.components.docker.Container:
    description: Docker container that should be run.
    derived_from: cloudify.nodes.Root
    properties:
      command:
        description: >
          Command that should be run in container. Note that command is a
          template that is expanded just before the container is started. All
          occurences of ``{attr_name}`` in this template will be replaced by
          the value of ``attr_name`` attribute.
        required: false
        default: null
      image:
        description: Name of the image that should be run.
        required: true
      tag:
        description: Image tag that should be run.
        required: true
      registry_auth:
        description: >
          Username and password for private registry. If image is from public
          registry, this property can be omitted.
        type: dice.datatypes.docker.RegistryAuth
        required: false
      port_mapping:
        description: >
          Map of container ports to host ports. If host port is set to
          ``null``, random port will be used for binding. Actual runtime
          mapping can be retrieved from ``port_mapping`` attribute. Typical
          examples of mapping would be ``80/tcp: 9876``, which will bind port
          80 from the container to host port 9876, and ``80/tcp: null``, which
          will bind container port 80 to random ephemeral port on host.
        required: false
        default: {}
      environment:
        description: >
          Map of environment variables and associated values that are passed
          to the container.
        required: false
        default: {}
      network:
        description: Network that container should be attached to.
        required: false
        default: null
      host:
        description: >
          Address of the docker host. If container is already connected to
          docker node, this property can be left out.
        required: false
        default: null
    attributes:
      id:
        description: Id of the container that has been created.
      name:
        description: Name of the container that has been created.
      port_mapping:
        description: >
          Instantiated port mapping. Any ports that were allowed to be mapped
          to random port in port_mapping property are in this mapping fixed to
          specific port.

  # Firewall rules for docker
  dice.firewall_rules.docker.Server:
    derived_from: dice.firewall_rules.Base
    description: >
      Firewall rules for basic docker setup. Note that this only opens ports
      for docker client-server communication, all other ports that containers
      might use need to be opened separately.

      Informs deployment services what docker instance will host current
      container. If this relationship is not set, container needs to have its
      host property set.
