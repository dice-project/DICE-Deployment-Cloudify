# OSv
# ===
#
# Currently, only OpenStack supports uploading OSv images. All platforms
# can create new OSv applications from images that are already uploaded (for
# example, from AMIs on AWS).

    # Why is osv.Application derived from image instead of server? Main reason
    # for doing this is to bypass Cloudify agent installation that is done by
    # default on types that derive from Compute node. Other reason is the fact
    # that we cannot remove attributes of parent type when deriving new type.
